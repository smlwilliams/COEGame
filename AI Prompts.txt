fix this code to have infinit game play.

this birst keeps dying at the first pipe, can you fix that?

The north and south pipes look broken almost like they overlap. and I don't want to game to reset unless i hit a pipe

remove the foreground

1. Remove the pipes
2. Add logic for elements that will be randomly placed on the screen moving like the pipes were moving. the elements will be named pa.png , pbi.png, pwa.png, and pva.png.
3. When I collide with them remove them from the screen and add 1 point to my score.
4. the game will end if one of the elements moves past the bird.

1. Add a highschore feature
2. make sure the elements are generated within the frame
3. only end the game if the element gets comletely behind the bird


add a logo to the top left of the app. the name is logo.png

can you put the logo infront of the background

the logo looks a bit squished can you respect the orginal aspect ratio?

how can you run a html javascript app in sharepoint

make the game faster ever 10 points scored. meaning the bird should move and fall faster. and the elements to move faster.

this is broken the elements stoped appearing make sure the game is infinte

don't forget to speed up the move up too

reduce the amount of elements generated back to back. increment the speed by 0.2 and make sure the elements are not generated too far apart in terms of height.
